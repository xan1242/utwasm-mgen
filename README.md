# Unreal & UT99 GOTY WebAssembly/Emscripten builder
This is a simple utility which enables you to regenerate manifest.json file necessary for running this version of this game.

# REQUIREMENTS
- Files from https://www.icculus.org/ut99-emscripten/flyby/wasm (index.html, index.wasm, index.js, cacheAppData.js)
- If used on Windows, you'll need gnuwin32 tree [found here](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tree.htm)
- Original UT GOTY game data, preferably stock (needed because it crashes without UT data)
- Original Unreal game data, again preferably stock
- HTTP web server (preferably just install Python and you're good to go)

# RELEASE BINARY
As the whole package currently contains copyrighted data from Epic Games, I cannot distribute it within this repository.

Therefore the release package in GitHub will only have the build of the sources here.
